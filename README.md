# Interactive_Dictionary_python
A user interactive dictionary created by python in which a json file is used to get the definition of the words that exist in the file
The purpose of this project was to be able to apply user interface, alongside with multiple conditionals, as well as being able to use a json file with information
The json file trial_data.json contains words, proper nouns, acronyms, in order to have conditionals that satisfy the words in the file.

Was able to accomplish importing on python as well as opening a json file alongside with multiple conditionals and user input.
